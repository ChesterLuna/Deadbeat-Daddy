  description: 'You and your date decide to paint portraits of each other, this is
    your time to show her how beautiful she is in your mind.

    After an intense
    2 hours you marvel at your amazing work. How gorgeous her eyes turned out, how
    soft her cheeks look, her plump lips. You are captivated.

    Your date watches
    your make out session with your painting in fear.

    -7 love points'
