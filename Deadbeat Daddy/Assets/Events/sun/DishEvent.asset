  description: "You try cooking her a dish. Unfortunately, you have been out of the
    living world for awhile so you are a bit rusty. You use old man hair instead
    of angel hair pasta, dandruff instead of parmesan, blood instead of tomato sauce\u2026
    but at least you got the meatballs right! Wait what kind of meat?\r\nShe holds
    in her vomit (scared that you would use it) and says she needs some air.\r\nIt\u2019s
    been a few hours, she\u2019s not coming back today\r\n-20 love points\r\n"
